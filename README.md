## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Stefano**, a software engineer based in :round_pushpin: Milan (Italy).  
GitHub has been the home for all my coding for more than 10 years, especially in the **macOS and iOS space**, from the Objective-C days with Manual Reference Counting, to Swift 6 and beyond: you'll find some highlights below.

I'm currently serving as **CTO** at [**Sherpo**](https://sherpo.io), an :robot: AI-first :one: all-in-one :white_flag: white-label platform revolutionizing the way content creators can :hammer_and_wrench: build, :globe_with_meridians: distribute, and :briefcase: manage their digital content. 

### Current "obsessions"
- :speech_balloon: [Sherpo's RAG-as-a-Product](https://dash.sherpo.io), bringing your knowledge to your audience in a few clicks (Î²eta)
- :cloud: [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects) + [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- :bird: [Swift Evolution](https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution), always a banger
